# BJData

The Binary JData (BJData) Specification defines an efficient serialization protocol for unambiguously storing complex
and strongly-typed binary data found in diverse applications. The BJData specification is the binary counterpart to the
JSON format, both of which are used to serialize complex data structures supported by the
[JData specification](https://openjdata.org). The BJData spec is derived and extended from the
[Universal Binary JSON(UBJSON)](https://ubjson.org) specification (Draft 12). It adds supports for N-dimensional packed
arrays and extended binary data types.
